My shortner url project! ðŸ“œðŸ¥³.

While i writing the my code, i used in google, youtube and github.

In this app you can enter your link into web site, and get a short id which you can always use to
redirect to your original website.

Also you can know how many times you redirected to this web from my app, and when you addded this link to my app.

The data is storage in jasonbin.io so you can see your links from every where, anytime.:)

I learned alot from google, youtube, and github when i get stucked while i writing the code

Enjoy.
