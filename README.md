## How it is works?
Submit url in the input that in home page, and you will get speacial id number as "shortUrl" value, take this number and write it insted of the "new" word at the url add, and you will redirect to your original url.

### Statistic
If you got to ...api/statistic:yourIdNumber you will see the number of times that you redirected to this address, the creation date, and the original URL.

### About the project 

This is my first project with Node.js

While i writing the my code, i used in google, youtube and github.

In this app you can enter your link into web site, and get a short id which you can always use to
redirect to your original website.

Also you can know how many times you redirected to this web from my app, and when you addded this link to my app.

The data is storage in jsonbin.io so you can see your links from every where, anytime.:)

I learned alot from google, youtube, and github when i get stucked while i writing the code

Here is a link to my app in replit : https://URL-shortner.gil6464.repl.co
